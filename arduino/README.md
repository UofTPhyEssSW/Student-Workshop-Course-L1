# Arduino IDE Framework

The Arduino IDE Frame has come alone way since it's introduction in the late 2000's. It is a very flexible platform that allows users to add custom libraries and board managers that give access to the simpliest to very complex microcontroller platforms. This makes it a good platform to introduce programming concepts.

## Installing board managers

<p>
The board manager was created by Earle F. Philhower since Arduino or the Raspberry PI foundation have not released version of their own. It comes highly recommended over other board managers for the Raspberry PI Pico micocontroller and will be used for this course. Instructions for installing the board manager are on the board manager projects <a href="https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico.git">GitHub page</a>. Please refer to it when installing the board manager.

## Installing libraries 

<p>
There are 3 libraries that need to be added to the Arduino IDE for coding with the Phyduino Pico.
</p>

1. Sparkfun STUSB4500 Arduino Library
2. MAX11635 ADC Arduino Library
3. Phyduino Pico Library.
