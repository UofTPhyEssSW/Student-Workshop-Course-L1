<p>
This is a non-credit Introduction to Electronics Graduate course for University of Toronto, Physics Gradute students, held over four, three-hour sessions which consist of one hour of lecture and two hours of practical time.
</p>

## Course Summary

<p>
This course is an Introduction to Electronics course where the student will learn how to solder through hole and surface mount components as well as learn about data acquisition (DAQ), power supplies, digital and analog electronics circuits. During the course the students will build a single channel DAQ board that measures ambient temperature and an Arduino Uno clone, which is theirs to take home. Please note that class has a maximum of 4 students and must have a minimum of 2 students registered for the class to be held.

If the class is full and your are still interested, please add yourself to the waiting list. We will try to schedule another course as soon as possible.

# Aruduino Framework
<p>
The Arduino IDE 2 is used to demostrate the Phyduino Pico and Analog Front End board. Since these are custom boards a new board manager and libraries must be installed in the IDE for the boards to be programmed. (<a href="https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/ide-v2-board-manager">instructions here</a>).

# Hardware 

<p>
All circuit boards for this course were designed using <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCad EDA</a> opensource software to make the schematic and PCB design files easy to access for the student. It's not requirement for the student to understand schematic symbols or PCB design the files are there for reference.
